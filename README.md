# {insert name of the game}

## Intro
This repository is intended for building final project for CFG degree in form of a game which is an adaptation of [Higher vs Lower game](http://www.higherlowergame.com/) and Google Arts & Culture [_What Came First?_ game](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/what-came-first/ZQGBUPErEE3bVg?hl=en). 
The game uses data extracted from [MET collections API](https://metmuseum.github.io/#object), and uses work of female artists only. There are significantly lower number of works by female artists in museums and galleries of the world. This game intends to help close this gap, and raise the profile of female artists. Through playing this game, users are invited to see the variety (although only very small percentage) of female artists in collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) and engage with their works.
